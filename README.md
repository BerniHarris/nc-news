 ## About
NC news has been created as part of my 13 week coding bootcamp at Northcoders and my first (of many I'm sure!) full stack application. 

Using the [API](https://github.com/BerniHarris/be-nc-news) I made in our backend module, NC News has been created as a simplified reddit style website using my freshly learnt front end knowledge.

## Features
Using my API, NC News allows you to:
- View a list of articles
- Filter articles by topics
- View comments written about specific articles
- Post comments about articles
- Delete comments
- Lke/ vote on articles
- Sort articles by when they were created, comment count and likes

## Getting Started
To run locally, this app requires **Node -v16.0.0**

Next run the following:

    git clone https://github.com/BerniHarris/nc-news.git
    cd nc-news
    npm i
    npm start

Thanks for looking!
